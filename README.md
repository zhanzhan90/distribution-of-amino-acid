# aa_position_pipeline.py
This is a python tool (python 2.7) to calculate the distribution of 20 amino acids of a given protein sequence. 

Fisrt of all, please store the protein sequence which you want to explore in the "inputseq.txt" as fasta format. Make sure the sequence file and "aa_position_pipeline.py" locate at the same folder. After running the code, a matrix containing the distribution of amino acids will be stored in "inputseq_aa_position.txt". The matrix could be further visualized as heatmap.
